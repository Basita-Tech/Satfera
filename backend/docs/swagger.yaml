  /api/v1/auth/logout:
    post:
      summary: Logout and invalidate session
      description: |
        Logs out the user by:
        1. Invalidating the session in the database (sets isActive=false)
        2. Clearing HTTP-only authentication cookies (token, csrf_token)

        This ensures the session cannot be reused even if someone obtains the cookie.
        The endpoint handles both valid and expired tokens gracefully.
